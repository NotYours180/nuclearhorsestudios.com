            <h3 class="title-box">What kind of game is The Rogue Sea?</h3>
            <p>
                The Rogue Sea can be loosely described as a Rogue-lite.
                Each time the player begins the game a new world is randomly
                generated.  This world consists of a series of islands, each
                island possibly containing towns, cities, buried treasure, 
                and other things to interact with. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fleet Captain (Player) looks over the map in the 
                Captain's Quarters of the fleet's flagship vessel.  He or 
                she chooses where to sail to, and handles affairs brought 
                to attention from the officers.  
            </p>
            <p>
                While sailing between islands the fleet may encounter 
                other friendly, neutral, and hostile ships.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The game is being primarily balanced around a perma-death
                experience, but will most likely include an "Easy" play
                mode which allows arbitrary saving. 
            </p>

            <h3 class="title-box">What makes TRS different and interesting?</h3>
            <p>
                The main thing is: the combat.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                One thing TRS has that hasn't been explored greatly in other 
                pirate games is really granular ship damage.   The ships can be 
                damaged, board by board.  The damage matters, aiming for an 
                opponents sails rips them apart and slows their ship down.  Aim
                closer to the main deck and take out cannons and crew.  Penetrate 
                a hull deeply enough and you might punch into the powder storage 
                of the opponent ship, blowing it to bits.  
            </p>
            <p>
                This granular damage model makes ship positioning very important.

            <h3 class="title-box">What is the setting of The Rogue Sea?</h3>
            <p>
                The Rogue Sea is a fictional section of the Carribean Sea defined 
                by convergence of vital shipping channels during the golden age of 
                piracy.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Nation-states wrestle for control of the Rogue Sea with little 
                regard for the people inhabiting the local islands.  The people
                struggle to survive as the heavy shipping volume brings with it 
                pollution and overfishing. With the local economies in turmoil, 
                and countless livelihoods destroyed, many turn to piracy.
            </p>

        <div class="content-box col-sm-10 col-xs-offset-1 col-xs-10">
            <h3 class="title-box">What is the combat like?</h3>
            <p>
                Combat takes place in real time, with the ability to 
                pause the action at any time and issue commands to fleet
                ships and crew members (navigational commands, aim / fire 
                weapon groups, brace for incoming fire, etc).
            </p>
            <p>
                The player can control a fleet of one or more ships, 
                and each ship can be heavily customized with regards to 
                combat abilities and also appearance. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Much work has been put into building technology to allow 
                interesting and meaningful ship destruction.  Ships are 
                modeled board by board, and each piece of the ship's 
                structure is destructible.  Sails deform and tear when 
                shot, making them less effective and slowing the ship.      
            </p>
            <p>
                Good tactics, timing, and aim matters, beyond just 
                lowering a simple "hull health" value.  Disabling key 
                components on an enemy ship may convince them to 
                surrender, allowing the player to seize the ship for 
                their fleet.  Or, the player can instead choose to just 
                bombard the enemy to bits and sink the ship... 
                increasing their infamy.

            <h3 class="title-box">Which platforms will The Rogue Sea release on?</h3>
            <p>
                The Rogue Sea is currently being built for Mac, Linux,

            <h3 class="title-box">How will the The Rogue Sea be funded?</h3>
            <p>
                A Kickstarter is planned, probably around mid-alpha.  It's 
                very important to me that the game is proven to be feasible
                and also fun before asking for any crowd funding.  
            </p>
            <p>
                If successful, the funding will primarily be used to buy 
                non-programmer art assets and to pay for help with overall
                art direction with actual artists.  Funding will also be 
                used for music production / licensing and other miscellaneous 
                costs
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm wearing of steam early-access funding, and that isn't 
                actively being planned at the moment.

            <h3 class="title-box">When will The Rogue Sea be released?  What is the current status?</h3>
            <p>
                Release date is still to be determined.  Early, broken but
                playable, alpha is scheduled to be ready within 2-3 months.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once technically playable, it will be seeded to progressively
                greater numbers of people for testing and feedback as 
                development continues.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, most of the basic technology that needed to be 
                built has been.  These things include basic ocean rendering,
                random island generation, granular ship destruction models,
                and Crew Management / AI / Pathfinding.  Work is now beginning 
                on tying these basic technology blocks together into something 
                interesting and fun.

            <h3 class="title-box">What's taking so long?</h3>
            <p>
                The Rogue Sea is currently being primarily developed by me,
                a single person.  I don't art very well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, many hours have been invested experimenting, 
                cutting scope, and building the basic technology needed 
                to create a pirate game that has real depth; rather than 
                a collection of pirate tropes wrapped in a generic 
                action-rpg.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether the game will be any good is still unknown, 
                but any failings it has will not be from lazily cutting 
                corners in the design.   
            </p>
            <p>
                I've had to build out a lot of of ideas, most bad, in order 
                to trim most of it away and carve out something focused 
                and interesting.

            <h3 class="title-box">What is your definition of Alpha, Beta, etc?</h3>
            <p>
                I define Alpha as being feature incomplete, but a cohesive
                experience with all major game systems in place.  In the 
                case of The Rogue Sea, this will be when a player can:
                <ul>
                    <li>Begin a new game</li>
                    <li>View the generated world islands</li>
                    <li>Choose an island or area to sail to</li>
                    <li>Encounter other fleets while sailing</li>
                    <li>Battle with other ships</li>
                    <li>Have a simple overall end/win state to work towards</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once those major systems are in place the 
                game will officially be in Alpha.  It will remain in alpha
                while gameplay is tweaked, subsystems added, and until 
                it is technically feature (but not content) complete.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the game is technically feature complete (basic code 
                for the game systems are in place), we'll enter Beta which 
                will be focused completely on bug fixes, game balance, 
                content, art and polish.    
            </p>

            <h3 class="title-box">Is this just an FTL clone with pirates?</h3>
            <p>
                No, though <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/" target="_new">
                FTL</a> is a great game and serves as inspiration 
                in number of areas, most notably the combat.  The Rogue 
                Sea uses a real-time, but pause-able, combat system. This 
                is similar in many ways to FTL, though in The Rogue Sea 
                the combat takes place in 3D on the ocean, making 
                navigation and positioning relevant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond that, things are quite different with regards to 
                pacing, micromanagement, and overall feel.  The player 
                sets their own pace through the world of The Rogue Sea 
                to a much greater extent, and most crew members are 
                almost entirely autonomous.
