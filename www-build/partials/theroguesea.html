Each time the player begins the game a new world is randomly generated. This world consists of a series of islands, each island possibly containing towns, cities, buried treasure, and other things to interact with.</p><p>The Fleet Captain (Player) looks over the map in the Captain's Quarters of the fleet's flagship vessel. He or she chooses where to sail to, and handles affairs brought to attention from the officers.</p><p>While sailing between islands the fleet may encounter other friendly, neutral, and hostile ships.</p><p>The game is being primarily balanced around a perma-death experience, but will most likely include an "Easy" play mode which allows arbitrary saving.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq2"></a> What is the setting of The Rogue Sea?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>The Rogue Sea is a fictional section of the Carribean Sea defined by convergence of vital shipping channels during the golden age of piracy.</p><p>Nation-states wrestle for control of the Rogue Sea with little regard for the people inhabiting the local islands. The people struggle to survive as the heavy shipping volume brings with it pollution and overfishing. With the local economies in turmoil, and countless livelihoods destroyed, many turn to piracy.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq3"></a> What is the combat like?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>Combat takes place in real time, with the ability to pause the action at any time and issue commands to fleet ships and crew members (navigational commands, aim / fire weapon groups, brace for incoming fire, etc).</p><p>The player can control a fleet of one or more ships, and each ship can be heavily customized with regards to combat abilities and also appearance.</p><p>Much work has been put into building technology to allow interesting and meaningful ship destruction. Ships are modeled board by board, and each piece of the ship's structure is destructible. Sails deform and tear when shot, making them less effective and slowing the ship.</p><p>Good tactics, timing, and aim matters, beyond just lowering a simple "hull health" value. Disabling key components on an enemy ship may convince them to surrender, allowing the player to seize the ship for their fleet. Or, the player can instead choose to just bombard the enemy to bits and sink the ship... increasing their infamy.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq4"></a> Which platforms will The Rogue Sea release on?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>The Rogue Sea is currently being built for Mac, Linux, and Windows.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq5"></a> How will the The Rogue Sea be funded?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>A Kickstarter is planned, probably around mid-alpha. It's very important to me that the game is proven to be feasible and also fun before asking for any crowd funding.</p><p>If successful, the funding will primarily be used to buy non-programmer art assets and to pay for help with overall art direction with actual artists. Funding will also be used for music production / licensing and other miscellaneous costs</p><p>I'm wearing of steam early-access funding, and that isn't actively being planned at the moment.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq6"></a> When will The Rogue Sea be released? What is the current status?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>Release date is still to be determined. Early, broken but playable, alpha is scheduled to be ready within 2-3 months.</p><p>Once technically playable, it will be seeded to progressively greater numbers of people for testing and feedback as development continues.</p><p>Currently, most of the basic technology that needed to be built has been. These things include basic ocean rendering, random island generation, granular ship destruction models, and Crew Management / AI / Pathfinding. Work is now beginning on tying these basic technology blocks together into something interesting and fun.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq7"></a> What's taking so long?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>The Rogue Sea is currently being primarily developed by me, a single person. I don't art very well.</p><p>In addition, many hours have been invested experimenting, cutting scope, and building the basic technology needed to create a pirate game that has real depth; rather than a collection of pirate tropes wrapped in a generic action-rpg.</p><p>Whether the game will be any good is still unknown, but any failings it has will not be from lazily cutting corners in the design.</p><p>I've had to build out a lot of of ideas, most bad, in order to trim most of it away and carve out something focused and interesting.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq8"></a> What is your definition of Alpha, Beta, etc?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>I define Alpha as being feature incomplete, but a cohesive experience with all major game systems in place. In the case of The Rogue Sea, this will be when a player can:<ul><li>Begin a new game</li><li>View the generated world islands</li><li>Choose an island or area to sail to</li><li>Encounter other fleets while sailing</li><li>Battle with other ships</li><li>Have a simple overall end/win state to work towards</li></ul></p><p>Once those major systems are in place the game will officially be in Alpha. It will remain in alpha while gameplay is tweaked, subsystems added, and until it is technically feature (but not content) complete.</p><p>After the game is technically feature complete (basic code for the game systems are in place), we'll enter Beta which will be focused completely on bug fixes, game balance, content, art and polish.</p></dt><dd><a name="faq9"></a> Is this just an FTL clone with pirates?</dd><dt class="darkened"><p>No, though <a href="http://www.ftlgame.com/" target="_new">FTL</a> is a great game and serves as inspiration in number of areas, most notably the combat. The Rogue Sea uses a real-time, but pause-able, combat system. This is similar in many ways to FTL, though in The Rogue Sea the combat takes place in 3D on the ocean, making navigation and positioning relevant.</p><p>Beyond that, things are quite different with regards to pacing, micromanagement, and overall feel. The player sets their own pace through the world of The Rogue Sea to a much greater extent, and most crew members are almost entirely autonomous.</p></dt></dl></section></div>
